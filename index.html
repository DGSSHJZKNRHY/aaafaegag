    <p>Gaming is love, Gaming is life
        My “hobby” is gaming. but I play quite often. Gaming is my way to relax. I spend my free time playing games online with my friends and it’s the way I connect with my friends. Gaming means to me a lot. I think i could not live without my mobile! My inspiration in gaming to become an Esports player when I got iphone 11 pro max for my birthday present a long time ago. My favourite game is PUBG MOBILE INDIA. In PUBG MOBILE INDIA i want to become an Esports player + Gaming Youtuber and i like more gmaes but PUBG is best and always be best Some people say gaming is just waste of time but no this is wrong why because when a good players play games they use their mind and hand-skills. You have to manage many things at same time like scope button, fire button, how many enemies alive , where are enemies coming from and more other things. I like more games but not very much example call of duty(cod) , Grand Theft Auto V(gta v) ,Minecraft(mc) and Darkness Rise(dkr).</p>
    <p id="p2">But some peoples have doubt like what is esports? i will tell - Esports (also known as electronic sports, e-sports, or eSports) is a form of competition using video games. Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events. </p>
